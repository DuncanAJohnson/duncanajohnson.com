Welcome back to week two of my weekly journal! I'm thrilled to have remembered to continue this endeavor. This week was a whirlwind of activities, from working on the Montal Prize application to an exciting trip to Atlanta.
Disclaimer: I talked for 15 minutes and then had AI generate this post, which I then edited lightly.

**Weekend Hustle: Montal Prize Application**
The weekend kicked off with a focus on the Montal Prize, a prestigious entrepreneurship award at Tufts for undergraduates. I dedicated significant time to perfecting my application. Amidst this, I managed to squeeze in some refreshing runs and bike rides, making the most of the crisp fall weather.

**Capstone and Probabilistic Robotics Presentations**
The start of the week was relatively calm, with a focus on preparing for upcoming travels. I spent Monday and Tuesday working on homework and presentations for my capstone and probabilistic robotics classes. The literature presentation for robotics went smoothly, and I felt well-prepared for the journey ahead.

**Triumph at the Montal Prize**
Before boarding my flight to Atlanta, I received thrilling news: I won the "Most Progress in a New Venture" award, securing $10,000 for my work at BX Coding. I'm grateful for this recognition for the work my team and I have put in over the past 5+ years.

**Atlanta Adventure: Startup Exchange Fellowship Pitch**
Wednesday marked the beginning of my Atlanta adventure. After a quick flight, Elliot picked me up, and we dove into preparations for the Startup Exchange Fellowship pitch event. Our product, a video transformer tool for educational videos, was well-received. Despite initial technical hiccups, the demo impressed many, and we garnered valuable feedback.

**Georgia Tech Fun**
Thursday offered a chance to unwind with Elliot's friends, exploring Atlanta, attending a Georgia Tech football game, and enjoying some downtime.

**Capstone Design Review**
Upon returning to Boston, I jumped straight into a design review for our capstone project. The feedback from Kenny and Beau, Tufts alumni, was invaluable in refining our MVP and focusing our efforts.

**Recurring Segment - Cool People I Met This Week**

+ **Kayli Joy Cooper:** A remarkable individual who runs a nonprofit delivering essential items to girls experiencing homelessness. Started and runs a nonprofit, even as a current undergraduate student.

+ **Kenny & Beau:** These two Tufts alumni, computer and electrical engineers who graduated in 2014, provided insightful feedback during our capstone design review, helping us hone our project direction.

+ **Josh Pullen:** A full-time math teacher in Michigan with a passion for ed tech. It's a pleasure to speak with Josh every two weeks as we talk about the wacky ed tech project each of us are working on.

Toodles.
