Hello and welcome back! February has kicked off with a whirlwind of activities, from perfecting pitches to advancing pilot programs and celebrating publication progress. As always, disclaimer: I talked for 10 minutes and then had AI generate this post, which I then edited lightly.

**Verse Pilot Progress:**
Over the weekend, we focused on ensuring Verse was running smoothly for Amber and Tracey at Park University. Elliot worked diligently on recording and transcription features, and we're thrilled to have their pilot underway. It's rewarding to see Verse being put to use in real educational settings, and we're eager to gather feedback.

**Microsoft Pitch Experience:**
Monday brought an unusual but exciting experience with our Microsoft pitch. We had a five-minute slot to present to a panel of Microsoft representatives, though it was a bit mysterious with no introductions or questions. Despite the odd setup, the pitch went smoothly, thanks to extensive practice and guidance from Elaine Chen and Aaliyah, who had been through the competition before. The pitch was clean and concise, and we're hopeful for a positive outcome.

**Georgia Tech InVenture Prize:**
Elliot is gearing up for the InVenture Prize semifinals at Georgia Tech, where he'll deliver a three-minute pitch followed by a ten-minute Q&A. With his knack for handling questions, it promises to be an engaging presentation. We're excited to showcase Verse to the Georgia Tech community and see how it resonates.

**Tufts Pilot and IRB Preparations:**
On the academic front, we secured a pilot program with Professor Tina Weber at Tufts, allowing us to conduct research and gather valuable data. I'm working on the IRB application this weekend to get the ball rolling for potential conference papers in Italy this summer. Additionally, I'm reaching out to other faculty to expand our pilot programs and gain more insights.

**4-H Book Manuscript:**
The final manuscript for the Ohio 4-H Scratch book is due soon, and I'm dedicating time this week to wrap it up. It's been a lengthy process, but I'm excited to see it come to fruition and hit the shelves later this year.

**ASEE Conference News:**
Exciting news on the publication frontâ€”Elliot's paper on Patch has been accepted for the ASEE Conference in Montreal this June. Although my paper on binary search tree cards needs revisions, I'm optimistic about refining it for future submission. Regardless, we're on our way to becoming published authors, which is a thrilling milestone.

It's been a busy but fulfilling week, and I'm looking forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Off to grab dinner now and recharge for the weekend grind.

Toodles.
