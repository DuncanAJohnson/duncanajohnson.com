Hello and welcome back! It's been quite the week with a mix of development work, unexpected opportunities, and some fun on the volleyball court. As always, disclaimer: I talked for 10 minutes and then had AI generate this post, which I then edited lightly.

**Verse Development:**
This week, we focused heavily on developing Verse, our voice-based discussion tool. We made significant progress on the debate mode, which aims to connect students in virtual classes through AI-driven debates. Although we were set to demo at the InVenture competition at Georgia Tech, a snow day postponed it to next Friday. Elliot will be pitching the debate mode, and we're excited to see how it resonates with the audience.

**Park University Meeting:**
On Wednesday, we had an interesting meeting with faculty from Park University, known for their online programs catering to military families. Despite a hiccup with the OpenAI API going down right before our demo, we managed to recover, and they're interested in testing Verse in a graduate class for K-12 teachers. It's thrilling to have our tool considered as an innovative ed tech solution so soon after its release.

**IRS Adventure:**
In less exciting news, I spent part of the week dealing with a mix-up on our 941 forms with the IRS. They mistakenly thought we needed to file for all quarters as a seasonal employer. After a lengthy rally, I sent off the necessary documentation, hoping to resolve the issue without a hefty $10,000 penalty.

**Microsoft Azure Cup Nomination:**
Elliot surprised me with big news that we've been nominated for the Microsoft Azure Cup, thanks to an eligibility quirk. The teams ahead of us in a previous pitch competition received VC investment, making them ineligible, so we get a shot at this prestigious competition. We'll be pitching in early February, and if successful, we'll advance to the semifinals with the chance for mentorship and funding. It's an unexpected opportunity, and we're eager to make the most of it.

**Intramural Volleyball:**
On a lighter note, intramural volleyball kicked off this week, and our first game is in just a few hours. It's a fun break from the hustle and bustle of projects and competitions, and I'm looking forward to getting the W with the team.

Classes are going well, and I'm managing to keep up with homework amidst all the excitement. It's been a productive and exhilarating week, and I can't wait to see what the next one brings.

Toodles.
