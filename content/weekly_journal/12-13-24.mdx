Welcome back! It's been a busy couple of weeks, and I missed an entry, so this one covers the last two weeks. Let's dive into the whirlwind of finals, projects, and entrepreneurial endeavors.
As always, disclaimer: I talked for 10 minutes and then had AI generate this post, which I then edited lightly.


**Non-profits Class Finale:**
The Nonprofits, Philanthropy, and Impact class that I TA for wrapped up, and it was a fulfilling experience. We awarded grants, reflected on the semester, and heard from the grant recipients about the impact of the funding. It was rewarding to see the practical application of our semester's work.

**Creative Business Law Project:**
In Business Law, I collaborated with Ella and Jacob on a final project where we fictionalized a watch company. We navigated through its lifecycle, applying everything we learned in class. Kudos to Professor Joe Volman for structuring the course effectively, blending guest lectures, content, and group work seamlessly.

**Trap the Sphero - Probabilistic Robotics:**
Luke and I completed our final project for Probabilistic Robotics, creating a game called Trap the Sphero. It teaches pathfinding and logical thinking to young kids. The project involved integrating computer vision with OpenCV, and despite some challenges with image processing, the presentation went well, and our class enjoyed the demonstration.

**Capstone Presentation:**
Our capstone project reached a significant milestone with the final presentation of the semester. We showcased the progress made, highlighting how all components are coming together. The feedback was encouraging, and we're excited to continue refining it over the winter break.

**Video Elevator Demo:**
We completed a video demo for Video Elevator, our tool aimed at enhancing educational videos. Next week, we'll reach out to about 40 Udemy educators to gather feedback and gauge interest. We're eager to see if we can achieve product-market fit with this initiative.

**Recurring Segment - Cool People I Met This Week**

+ **Usha Pasi:** My Nonprofits, Philanthropy, and Impact professor, who masterfully leads a class through difficult challenges of building nonprofits and giving $25,000 of grants to local nonprofits.

+ **Joe Volman:** My Business Law professor, who showed me that good teaching is simply being knowledgable and caring about sharing that knowledge.

Looking forward to a productive winter break and the opportunities it will bring.

Toodles.
