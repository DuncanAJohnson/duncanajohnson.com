Hello and welcome back! It's the start of a new semester at Tufts University, and I'm excited to dive into a fresh set of classes and projects. This entry is focused on my academic schedule, and I'll save updates on work and other ventures for next time. As always, disclaimer: I talked for 10 minutes and then had AI generate this post, which I then edited lightly.

**Class Rundown:**

**Machine Learning:**
This semester, I'm taking a machine learning class with a bunch of computer science friends I've made over the years. It's going to be a mix of supervised and a bit of unsupervised learning, with a focus on foundational concepts. We're diving into low-level implementations, which should be both challenging and rewarding. I'm looking forward to collaborating on projects and expanding my understanding of ML.

**Biology 14:**
To fulfill a requirement for my CS degree, I'm enrolled in Biology 14, an introductory biology course. It's a large class with around 400 students, reminiscent of high school with its frequent assignments and labs. Though it's not my usual cup of tea, I'm taking it with Quinn, and we're hoping to make the most of the experience, even if it's just memorizing facts about plants and animals.

**Entrepreneurial Finance:**
I'm also taking an entrepreneurial finance course, which promises to be rigorous but rewarding. The professor seems incredibly knowledgeable, and the class will cover company valuations and financial statements. Given my experience managing finances for both nonprofit and for-profit ventures, I'm eager to deepen my understanding and apply these skills to the startup world. The class meets once a week for three hours, which should allow for some in-depth discussions.

**Capstone Project: SnapBot:**
Finally, my capstone project, SnapBot, is a major focus this semester. The course is hands-off, with only a few formal meetings, allowing us to concentrate on development sprints with Ethan and the Eucalyptus team. We're aiming to make significant progress and hopefully prepare for publication in 2026. I'm excited about the potential of SnapBot and the opportunity to continue research for CS credit next semester.

With a schedule that leaves Tuesdays and Thursdays for classes, I have plenty of unblocked time to dedicate to Verse and SnapBot. I'm looking forward to balancing classwork with these exciting projects and making the most of this semester.

Toodles!
