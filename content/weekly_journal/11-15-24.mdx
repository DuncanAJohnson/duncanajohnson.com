Welcome the inaugural entry of my weekly journal, where I'm going to share the mix of activities, thoughts, and projects I embark upon each week. 
I don't care if anyone reads this, I just want a public log that keeps me accountable to building and learning. I talked for 15 minutes and then had AI generate this post, which I then edited.

**Weekend Getaway to NYC**
Last weekend, I stepped away from work entirely and took a refreshing trip to New York City with Olivia.

**Tackling the 990-PF Form:**
This week was dominated by the task of completing the 990-PF form for BX Coding, which resulted in us paying a grand total of $1 in tax (based on our checking account interest). LOL.

**Snapbot (CS Capstone):**
Work continued on Snapbot, my CS Capstone project. We did our formal project proposal presentations and plunged into documentation, and I'm excited to dive into the AI code generation aspect soon.

**Ohio 4-H Book: A Collaborative Effort:**
The project on authoring a book for Ohio 4-H on Scratch is progressing well. McKenzie from BX Coding has been outstanding in her work, and our recent meeting with the team validated our direction. 

**IRLI Research Group Presentation:**
Last Thursday, I was part of a presentation alongside Ethan Danahy and Mehek at the IRLI Research Group meeting, where we discussed generative AI in education. I got to present about all the wacky AI stuff Elliot and I have done over the past year.

**AI Educational Video Tool Pitch:**
Aiming to create a tool for enhancing educational videos with AI, Elliot and I pitched at the Tufts Ideas Competition. We didn't win, but it was fun to pitch and see all the other finalist ideas!

**Recurring Segment - Cool People I Met This Week**

+ **Dr. David Joyner:** Our conversation traversed topics like online asynchronous education and course development. One of the titans of the online learning space and a joy to speak with.

+ **David Collien:** We had a fantastic and invigorating conversation about online pedagogy and shared enthusiasm for advancing ed tech. I'm excited to see how Open Learning continues to innovate.

+ **Millie Liu:** Millie was a guest speaker in my Business Law class at Tufts. Her journey from pure math to AI and then venture capital is awesome and she spends a third of her time just reading research papers to get a leg up when investing.

Toodles.
