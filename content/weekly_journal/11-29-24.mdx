**Rest**
After the whirlwind trip to Atlanta, I took much-needed time off during Thanksgiving break.

**Robotics Work**
One of the only bits of work I did this week was working on my probabilistic robotics and capstone projects.

**Trip to Toronto**
For Thanksgiving, I went to Toronto to visit family. It was great to spend some time down south, since Toronto is surprisingly south of Boston.

**Fake Facts**
Just now, I made up a fake fact (otherwise known as a lie). Toronto (43.6 degrees of latitude) is north of Boston (42.4 degrees of latitude).

**Shout-out Toronto City Airport**
I love Porter Airlines, you can fly from Boston to the Toronto City Airport which is so easy to get to compared to the big Toronto Pearson airport.

Toodles.
